# Project-Create

The code in this repo was created as a part of my 2022 summer internship in Tufts Center for Engineering Education and Outcreach. During this internship I worked with iRobot's education team and their Create 3 robots to design course curriculum for an Intro the Engineering Course at Tufts. The course will start out with a scratch like coding environemnt and move all the way through ROS2 and their python client library. Here are the examples and projects I made over the course of the summer.
